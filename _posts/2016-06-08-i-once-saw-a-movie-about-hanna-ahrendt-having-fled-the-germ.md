  I once saw a movie about Hanna Ahrendt, having fled the German socialists. She
  had arrived in New York City, trying to start up a new life. Somewhat like
  that, I feel here in Zürich, Switzerland right now in 2016, having fled the
  socialist from the Netherlands, the Nezi's, who tried to kill me, but who did
  not succeed. The latter not being too much of a wonder: Anybody, who is still
  a socialist almost one hundred years after the biggest slaughter in human
  history commenced, is either a criminal or otherwise mentally retarded.
