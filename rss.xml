            <description><![CDATA[<p>I once saw a movie about Hanna Ahrendt, having fled the German socialists. She had arrived in New York City, trying to start up a new life. Somewhat like that, I feel here in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland right now in 2016, having fled the socialist from the Netherlands, the Nezi's, who tried to kill me, but who did not succeed. The latter not being too much of a wonder: Anybody, who is still a socialist almost one hundred years after the biggest slaughter in human history commenced, is either a criminal or otherwise mentally retarded.</p>]]></description>
